## Amphipolis Board Game Overview

Amphipolis is a board game designed by Reiner Knizia, where players take on the roles of archaeological teams working to save as many artifacts as possible from an archaeological site threatened by landslides. The game combines elements of strategy, timing, and resource management as players compete to gather the most valuable artifacts before the site becomes inaccessible due to landslides.

### Rules Summary

The goal of the game is to collect the most valuable combination of artifacts, represented by tiles, before the game ends due to simulated landslides. Players aim to maximize their score based on the combinations of artifacts they collect.

#### Gameplay
- Artifact Collection: On their turn, players draw a set number of artifact tiles from a bag, which may include various types of artifacts (mosaics, pots, statues, skeletons) and landslide tiles.
- Sorting Artifacts: Players sort the drawn tiles into categories on the game board.
- Selecting Artifacts: After sorting, players select two artifacts from a chosen category.
- Using Helper Cards: Players may optionally play one of four helper cards (the assistant, the archaeologist, the digger, or the professor) to gain additional benefits, such as collecting more tiles.
- Scoring: Collecting certain combinations of artifacts increases a player's score. The game ends when a predetermined number of landslide tiles are placed on the board, and the player with the highest score wins.


##### Winning the Game
The game is won by the player who accumulates the most points from collecting valuable artifact combinations before the site becomes too dangerous due to landslides.
