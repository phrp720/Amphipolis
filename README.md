# Amphipolis Board Game Simulation

## Overview

This project was initiated in 2021 as part of academic coursework aimed at simulating the board game "Amphipolis". The primary objective was to understand and apply software engineering principles, particularly focusing on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The application is developed using Java, leveraging Maven for project management and packaging, and Java AWT/Swing for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Model**: Represents the core logic of the game, including the state of the game board, player actions, and the rules governing the game.
- **View**: Manages the display of the game state to the user, providing visual feedback on the game's progress.
- **Controller**: Handles user inputs, translating them into actions within the model, and updating the view accordingly.

## Technologies

- **Java**: The programming language used throughout the project.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used for dependency management and project assembly.
- **Java AWT/Swing**: Libraries used for creating the graphical user interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Install Apache Maven following the official documentation.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
5. Buid the application and run:

           java -jar target/amphipolis.jar


## Usage

After launching the application, you will be presented with the game's GUI. Follow the on-screen instructions to start playing the game. The application provides options to start a new game, load a saved game, and access settings.
